* Fashy Detector

  Detect signatories for rms-open-letter (the "against letter"), in hope of helping data mining/analysis studies.
  For research purpose only.

  Run ~detect.lisp~ in from Common Lisp environment.
  Or see pre-generated list of GitHub usernames in ~github-users.txt~ and emails in ~emails.txt~.

* How it works

  Unlike support letter, the against letter is very opaque in its signing/verfication procedure.
  Therefore we do it at best effort.

  Currently two strategies are deployed
  - Manual entries. Sometimes someone get some attention.
  - Commit emails. It can be either real email, or dummy one of the form ~username@users.noreply.github.com~
  - Commit message. Their maintainers make lots of (probably generated by default) commit message of the form
    ~Merge pull request from username/balabala~. We can then get the username.
TODO:
  - GitHub repo API in JSON. It doesn't really cover all users I extract from commit history, but is nice supplement.
